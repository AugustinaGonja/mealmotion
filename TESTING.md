## Automated Testing
### WC3 HTML & CSS Validator
The W3C Validator was used to check and validate the HTML and CSS for all pages of the website. Validation was performed by direct input page’s web link into the tool.<br><br>

**HTML Validator**
* [Home Page](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fstrength-stack-e65fe8f9116b.herokuapp.com%2F) - No errors or warnings.
* [Index Page]() - No errors or warnings.
* [Add & Edit Products]() - No errors or warnings.
* [Recipes]() - No errors or warnings.
* [Recipe Details]() - No errors or warnings.
* [Profile]() - No errors or warnings.
* [Shopping Bag]() - No errors or warnings.
* [Checkout]() - No errors or warnings.
* [Checkout Success]() - No errors or warnings.
* [Registration]() - No errors or warnings.
* [Login]() - No errors or warnings.
* [Logout]() - No errors or warnings.
* [404 Error Page]() - There are no other errors; the validator simply identified the 404 page.
* [500 Error Page]() - No errors or warnings.<br>


**CSS Validator**<br>
I just submitted the css directly through the WC3 CSS Validator.
* [base.css Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator) - No Error Found.
* [checkout.css Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator) - No Error Found
* [Internal CSS in the profile.html](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator) - No Error Found

### Python Validator
To validate all my Python code, I used the Code Institute [Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/).<br>
All was clear with no errors found. Below, I’ve provided Python validations for 4 of my more detailed apps as examples.<br><br>

**"products" App :**

### Django Testing

# Performance Testing ( Wave & Lighthouse )
**Wave Contrast Checker**

I used the WAVE Contrast Checker to verify if my webpages passed accessibility standards.
All pages pass the color contrast checker, ensuring accessibility and readability for all users.
I made sure text and background colors work together.

## Performance Results 
I used Lighthouse on ChromeDevTools to test perfomance of my website on desktop - page by page.
<br>The results are as shown below.

### Desktop
* [Home Page](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fstrength-stack-e65fe8f9116b.herokuapp.com%2F) - No errors or warnings.
* [Index Page]() - No errors or warnings.
* [Add & Edit Products]() - No errors or warnings.
* [Recipes]() - No errors or warnings.
* [Recipe Details]() - No errors or warnings.
* [Profile]() - No errors or warnings.
* [Shopping Bag]() - No errors or warnings.
* [Checkout]() - No errors or warnings.
* [Checkout Success]() - No errors or warnings.
* [Registration]() - No errors or warnings.
* [Login]() - No errors or warnings.
* [Logout]() - No errors or warnings.
* [404 Error Page]() - There are no other errors; the validator simply identified the 404 page.
* [500 Error Page]() - No errors or warnings.<br>

**To summarise :**  
Performance scores for the Index, Home, and 404 pages were some of the lowest at 73, the lowest being the 500 page at 71, which is below the desired level but passable.
I suspect that Chrome extensions may have impacted these results. 
Aside from that, most performance metrics were in the green.

SEO only dropped into the orange range on the 404 page.

Accessibility scores ranged from approximately 85 to the 90s.

Best Practices consistently scored 100, with only a few instances ranging between 90-100.
